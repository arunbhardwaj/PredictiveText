# PredictiveText

### What I learned:
- Studied and implemented a basic predictive text algorithm that form the basis for machine learning and autocomplete functions in search and mobile phones
- Studied and implemented interfaces to reduce common code, avoid duplicating code, and supply default functionality when possible
- Studied and implemented abstract classes to allow for extensibility of future code, and that can capture common code that an interface cannot
